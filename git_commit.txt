feat: Enhance portfolio analysis and UI

Refactor and improve various aspects of portfolio analysis and user interface:

- **Factor Analysis:**
    - Enable dynamic selection and display of factor models (e.g., Carhart 4-Factor).
    - Improve readability of factor analysis results with HTML formatting and model-specific interpretations.
    - Connect UI button to trigger full data refresh for factor analysis recalculation.
- **Correlation Matrix:**
    - Ensure correlation matrix only includes currently held stocks.
    - Remove redundant table display from the correlation matrix tab.
    - Correct axis label orientation (horizontal) and center the plot within its tab.
- **General Improvements:**
    - Resolve `NameError` for `map_to_yf_symbol` import.
    - Make transaction 'Type' column comparison case-insensitive for broader data compatibility.
    - Fix `AttributeError` related to `market_data_provider` initialization.
