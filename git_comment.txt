feat: Implement holdings table grouping by sector with subtotals

This commit introduces a new feature allowing users to group the main holdings table by sector.

Key changes include:
- Added a "Group by Sector" checkbox to the main GUI.
- Enhanced `_get_filtered_data` to perform data grouping by sector, inserting header rows with subtotals for relevant financial columns (e.g., Market Value, Day Change, Unrealized Gain).
- Refactored UI update logic to ensure the "Value by Holding" pie chart always displays ungrouped data, while the table reflects the grouping preference.
- Implemented theme-aware background coloring for sector header rows to improve visual distinction.
- Resolved dependency conflicts by downgrading NumPy to a compatible version and adding `statsmodels` to project requirements.

This feature significantly improves the analytical capabilities of the holdings table by providing aggregated views at the sector level.
